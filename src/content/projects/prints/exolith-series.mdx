The animation <i>namaste</i> below was inspired by my exolith.form[] series of digital prints. The organism has been constructed
from a series of mathematical splines that are altered in a progressive manner to create both similarity and
variation. I was inspired by Ernst Haeckel’s drawings that popularized Darwin’s work as well as his own
theory on biological development in the late 19th century. His drawings seemed to find order in nature and purpose in
the structures that felt at once organic and manufactured.
