title: systems
subtitle: Interactive projection on paper sculpture

<i>Systems</i> is a series exploring shape, color and motion realized through programming and experiments with
how computers draw shapes to the screen. I was inspired by the simple geometry of diatoms and the layered colors
of southern New Mexico and Arizona. Diatoms are living organisms and are found nearly everywhere, creating
almost half of the oxygen that we breathe, but their unique forms feel very mechanical to me, like little
machines. Iâ€™m really interested in the boundary between natural, living things and how digital code can be used
to create things that feel very much alive. The projected image is not a pre-recorded video, but an evolving
landscape created through code, algorithms and latent artifacts rendering to the screen. In this way, I hope to
evoke reflections on the hidden beauty found in geometry, code and nature.
