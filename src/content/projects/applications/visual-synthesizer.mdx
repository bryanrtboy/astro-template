This application turns touches into physics-based interactions; the collisions that result create sounds based on where
they hit and impact velocity. The result is a soothing and endless melodic tune that will never repeat itself. The
visuals provide an ambient backdrop to help you play. The capsules represent your touch, each moving dot is a
physics-enable ball that contains a note. Hit a ball, and the note plays. If the ball hits the edges of the screen, the
collision also triggers the note.

Jazz guitar virtuoso Paul Musso provided guitar recordings of chords typically used to create a melody â€“ F#, D#, C and
G. Finger touches (supports up to 4 simultaneous touches) creates collisions that will trigger one of these chords.
Every 3 seconds, the key is randomly changed to either A Minor, C, F or G.
