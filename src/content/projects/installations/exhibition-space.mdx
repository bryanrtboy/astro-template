An installation that explores the gallery as a social construction. Through observation of the gallery
architecture and research into its history I developed an installation that exposed the gallery – windows
that existed but were ignored, artifacts that were unearthed and moved. The room could have simply been a
classroom if the room had been labeled as such, but since it is labeled a fine art gallery people enter it in a
different way and have different expectations from it.

I explored the six major planes of the gallery cube – ceiling, floor and walls by investigating the surfaces
and drawing attention to what existed behind the surfaces. I drilled holes in the drywall, exposing the window
behind and created a camera lucida by projecting through a lens onto frosted plexiglass. A security monitor
recorded the adjacent closet housing the gallery coordinator.

The installation emitted a drone sound and remained that way until a person entered the cube. Upon entering,
sensors detected their presence and allowed them to ‘perform’ the cube by using their body to distort the
video and audio. The video was a live feed and would capture images of the last person who activated the central
cube, keeping their image static until the next subject entered the space. The sensor was a Theremin and has
subsequently been used in performances of Temporal Interference.
