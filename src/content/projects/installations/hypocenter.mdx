Beneath the surface of the water, faces of hopeful people wait to be freed by the presence of an audience. In
this interactive video installation, each origami crane represents a person who has included the phrase “I hope”
in a recent tweet posted on Twitter.

While the installation is running, cranes are continuously created and float aimlessly on the surface of the
water. If nobody approaches, the cranes drift off and are replaced by new ones. When people are active near the
installation there is the potential that the people will be freed and the cranes will fly off into the
distance.

The setting is loosely based on the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial, not as it appears today,
but in an imagined future.
